                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>Our story began in 2010, when we opened our first restaurant in the heart of New York City. We were a small family business, but we had a big dream: to make the best pizza in the world. And we did it! Our pizza became famous all over the city, and soon people from all over the world were coming to taste it. Today, we have restaurants in every corner of the globe, but we still make our pizza the same way we did back then: with love, passion, and the best ingredients. Come and taste the magic!</p>
